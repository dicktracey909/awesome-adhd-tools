# Awesome ADHD Tools [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of apps, tools, and resources designed for ADHD brains — not adapted from neurotypical productivity systems.

Most productivity tools assume you can plan ahead, maintain routines, and remember what you were doing five minutes ago. These don't.

## Memory & Capture Tools

The biggest ADHD bottleneck isn't motivation — it's working memory. These tools externalize what your brain can't hold.

- [JotBud](https://jotbud.com) - ADHD memory companion on Telegram. Brain dump everything in one message — AI parses, sorts, and reminds you. Morning briefings, context recovery ("what was I doing?"), and no guilt-tripping.
  - [How brain dump parsing works](https://jotbud.com/features/brain-dump)
  - [How morning briefings work](https://jotbud.com/features/morning-briefing)
  - [How context recovery works](https://jotbud.com/features/context-recovery)
- [Apple Reminders](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108343) - Dead simple, voice-activated via Siri. "Hey Siri, remind me to call the dentist tomorrow at 9am." Zero friction capture.
- [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) - Quick notes that sync everywhere. Checkboxes, voice memos, image capture. Low enough friction for ADHD brains.
- [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/) - AI meeting transcription. Stop trying to listen AND take notes simultaneously — let AI handle the notes.
- [Notion](https://notion.so/) - Powerful but dangerous for ADHD. Works if someone else sets up the system. Fails if you spend 3 hours designing templates instead of doing things.

### Why Capture Matters for ADHD

Adults with ADHD have impaired working memory — the brain's temporary holding space. Neurotypical brains hold 7±2 items; ADHD brains hold fewer, and items decay faster. Every uncaptured thought competes for limited cognitive resources. [Read more about memory offloading for ADHD →](https://jotbud.com/blog/memory-offload)

## Task Management

### ADHD-First Design

- [Goblin Tools](https://goblin.tools/) - AI-powered task breakdown. Give it "clean the kitchen" and it returns 12 specific steps. Magic Goblin breaks paralysis by making tasks concrete.
- [Tiimo](https://www.tiimo.dk/) - Visual daily planner built for ADHD and autism. Color-coded timelines instead of text lists.
- [Llama Life](https://llamalife.co/) - Time-boxed task list with a visible countdown. Creates urgency without anxiety.
- [Structured](https://structured.app/) - Visual time blocking with a timeline view. See your whole day at a glance.
- [Routinery](https://routinery.app/) - Step-by-step routine runner. Turns "morning routine" into a guided sequence with timers for each step.

### General Task Managers (ADHD Considerations)

- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) - Clean, fast, cross-platform. Works well for ADHD if you keep it simple (single project, no nested sub-tasks). Fails when it becomes a graveyard of overdue tasks. [Honest ADHD review →](https://jotbud.com/blog/todoist-adhd)
- [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/) - Built-in Pomodoro timer and habit tracker. Less likely to become a task graveyard because the timer creates urgency.
- [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - Beautiful, opinionated design. "Today" view forces daily prioritization. Apple-only.
- [Sunsama](https://sunsama.com/) - Daily planning ritual that pulls tasks from other tools. The guided "shutdown" routine helps ADHD brains actually stop working.

### The ADHD App Graveyard Problem

The average ADHD adult has tried 5+ productivity apps. The pattern: excited download → enthusiastic setup → 3 days of use → forgotten. The problem isn't willpower — it's that most apps require consistent maintenance, which is exactly what ADHD makes hard. [Why this happens →](https://jotbud.com/blog/app-graveyard)

## Focus & Time Management

### Focus Music & Soundscapes

- [Brain.fm](https://www.brain.fm/) - AI-generated music scientifically designed for focus. Patent-backed neural entrainment. Many ADHD adults swear by it.
- [Endel](https://endel.io/) - Adaptive soundscapes that respond to time, weather, and heart rate.
- [myNoise](https://mynoise.net/) - Highly customizable noise generators. White noise, rain, café ambiance. Free.

### Focus Timers

- [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/) - Plant a virtual tree, don't touch your phone until it grows. Gamified focus timer.
- [Focusmate](https://www.focusmate.com/) - Video body doubling sessions with strangers. Book a 25/50-minute session and work alongside someone. Surprisingly effective for ADHD.
- [Pomodoro Timer](https://pomofocus.io/) - Simple 25/5 timer. The Pomodoro technique works for ADHD because it makes the work feel finite.
- [Flow](https://flowapp.info/) - Pomodoro timer for Mac with menu bar integration.

### Time Blindness Tools

Time blindness is one of ADHD's most disruptive symptoms — the inability to feel time passing.

- [Time Timer](https://www.timetimer.com/) - Visual countdown showing time as a shrinking colored disk. Makes time visible.
- [Due](https://www.dueapp.com/) - Nagging reminders that repeat every few minutes until you act. Sounds annoying. Works brilliantly for ADHD.

## Routine & Habit Building

- [Routinery](https://routinery.app/) - Guided routines with step-by-step timers. Externalizes executive function for repetitive sequences.
- [Finch](https://finchcare.com/) - Self-care through caring for a virtual pet. Low-pressure habit building. Celebrates small wins.
- [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) - Gamified habits — your tasks are RPG quests. Works for ADHD brains motivated by novelty and rewards.
- [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com/) - Simple, visual. Maximum 12 habits. The constraint prevents the ADHD tendency to over-commit.

### Why Habits Are Harder with ADHD

ADHD brains have lower baseline dopamine, making routine activities feel unrewarding. Habit formation relies on consistent repetition — the exact thing that ADHD disrupts. External structure (timers, gamification, accountability) compensates for internal executive function gaps. [Coping strategies that actually work →](https://jotbud.com/blog/coping-strategies)

## Body Doubling & Accountability

Body doubling = working alongside another person. The presence of another person activates ADHD brains in ways that solo work can't.

- [Focusmate](https://www.focusmate.com/) - Virtual body doubling. 25 or 50-minute video sessions with matched partners.
- [Flow Club](https://www.flow.club/) - Group coworking sessions with hosts. More structured than Focusmate.
- [FLOWN](https://www.flown.com/) - Deep work sessions with facilitators. Premium but high quality.
- [Caves](https://caves.land/) - Discord-based coworking. Free, community-run.

---

## Emotional Regulation

ADHD isn't just attention — it's emotion regulation, rejection sensitivity, and burnout.

- [Finch](https://finchcare.com/) - Gentle self-care companion. No streaks to break, no shame.
- [Calm](https://www.calm.com/) - Meditation and sleep stories. The "Daily Calm" is short enough for ADHD attention spans.
- [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) - Guided meditation with ADHD-friendly short sessions (3-5 minutes).
- [Daylio](https://daylio.net/) - Mood tracking without writing. Tap icons instead of journaling. Low friction.

### Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD)

Nearly all adults with ADHD experience RSD — intense emotional pain from perceived rejection or criticism. A casual comment can trigger hours of rumination. Understanding RSD is the first step to managing it. [What RSD is and how to manage it →](https://jotbud.com/blog/rejection-sensitivity)

## The ADHD Tax

The ADHD tax is the hidden cost of executive dysfunction: late fees, expired memberships, duplicate purchases, missed appointments, abandoned subscriptions. Studies estimate it costs adults $4,000–$10,000+ per year.

Every tool on this list exists to reduce some part of that tax. [Full breakdown of the ADHD tax →](https://jotbud.com/blog/adhd-tax)
